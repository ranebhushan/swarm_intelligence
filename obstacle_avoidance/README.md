This repository is based on the following paper : [Mirollo, R. E., & Strogatz, S. H. (1990). Synchronization of pulse-coupled biological oscillators. SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, 50(6), 1645-1662](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0150098)

## Description

### Obstacle Avoidance

Avoiding obstacles is one of the most common behaviors. The aim of this exercise is to implement
an obstacle avoidance strategy for your swarm. For this exercise, youâ€™ll use the proximity sensor and
the robot wheels.

**Proximity Sensor Labeling**



### Synchronization

Simplified implementation of algorithm to achieve global synchronization, can be summarized as :

```
init:
    state = 0
    c = random(0,T)
step:
    c = c + 1
    if(a neighbor flashed)
        c = c + k * c
    if(c >= T)
        state = 1
        c = 0
    else
        state = 0
```

In the above algorithm, `c` is an internal counter; `T` is the maximum value the counter can assume; and `k` is a constant between 0 and 1. We assume that each agent can see the neighbors on its north, east, south and west while implementing this algorithm, with setting `T` to 100.

The range-and-bearing communication system and the LEDs are used in this exercise.
